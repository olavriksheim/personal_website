          <h3>Film Project</h3>
          <h5>Hacking</h5>
          <p>
            My group made a film about hacking, and where the border for what's
            acceptable should lay. Now that more and more information is
            digitalised, it's becoming more important to protect ths
            information. Therefore, malicious hackers are one of the biggest
            problems we face today. But not all hackers have malicious intents.
            Some have joined the battle against malicious hackers. We can
            categorise hackers into three categories: Black hats, White hats and
            Grey hats. Black hats are the typical hackers with malicious
            intents. They try to steal information, disable computer systems
            etc. White hats are hackers that try to improve security. They try
            to hack into systems, so they can fix eventual errors. Grey hats lie
            between Black- and White hats. They often try to help, but do it
            whitout permission. We can now ask ourselves, what these hackers
            shopuld be allowed to do. This is a very hard question, since each
            and every person has their own borders. We can therefore not answer
            where the border should lie.
